ApplyBoard is the first worldwide, online application tool for students to apply to universities and colleges in Canada and the U.S.A. We are a web based organization, accessible around the globe, powered by an international group of experts who truly understand your frustrations and are here to help. We provide unmatched access to best-in-class programs from first rate schools, colleges and universities, using proprietary software to help you make informed decisions and get you enrolled in the program of your choice as smoothly and painlessly as possible with today's technology. ApplyBoard was started by a group of international students who understand the difficulties and obstacles that international students face and decided to revolutionize the recruitment process. Today our team has helped thousands of students realize their dreams of studying abroad.
